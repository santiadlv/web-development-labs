# Web App Development Class

This repository is aimed at hosting all laboratory practices done on this course throughout the year. Each practice will have its own folder, with a global *.gitignore*
to leave out Java-specific runtime files, alongside IDE configuration files. 

If you encounter problems runnning any of the tests, make sure to contact me so we can look closely at the issue.
